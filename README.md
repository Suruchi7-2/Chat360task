### Centralized Logging with Query Interface
This project implements a system for capturing logs from various APIs, storing them in a central location, and providing a user interface to search and filter the logs.

### Features:

Log Ingestion: Captures logs from different APIs and writes them to designated files or a database (optional).
Log Storage:
Default: Stores logs in text files (log1.log, log2.log, etc.) based on API source (configurable).
Optional: Supports integration with a MongoDB database for high-volume logging and complex querying.
Query Interface (Planned):
Web interface for users to search and filter logs based on:
Timestamp
Log message content
API source
Retrieves filtered logs and displays them to the user.
Project Structure:

### log_injector.js: Handles log capture from APIs, formatting, and writing to log files or database (if implemented).
config.json: Configuration file for mapping API sources to log files.
query_interface.js (Planned Implementation): Script for the query interface functionality (frontend framework integration needed).
How it Works:

API Interactions: Your application interacts with various APIs.
Log Capture: The log_injector.js script captures log messages and data (source, timestamp) generated by API calls.
Log Storage: Logs are written to designated log files (text files) or a MongoDB database (optional) based on the API source.
User Interaction (Planned): Users access the web-based Query Interface.
Search and Filter: Users enter search criteria (timestamp, log string, source) to filter the logs.
Query Processing: The Query Interface interacts with the log storage (text files or database) based on the search criteria.
Results Display: Filtered logs are retrieved and displayed back to the user interface.

### Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Install dependencies:
Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
Optional: Configure config.json if using a different log file structure.
To run log ingestion:
Bash
node log_injector.js
Use code with caution.
Planned Implementation: Develop the Query Interface using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js.
Considerations:

### This project provides a foundation for log ingestion and querying.
The Query Interface needs frontend development to create a user interface.
Choose between text files or a database based on your logging volume and query complexity.
Future Enhancements:

Implement user authentication and authorization for the Query Interface.
Add support for pagination to handle large datasets.
Explore advanced filtering options and visualizations.
We welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your enhancements.
